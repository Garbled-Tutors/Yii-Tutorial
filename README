This is a walkthrough of fundamental features of yii. I am currently teaching myself this framework and I am doing this to help my own understanding. The CHANGELOG will keep track of feature lists and should contain commit identification for when this feature began coding, and when it finished. Also it will contain a list of edited files and an explanation of what was changed.
