protected/runtime/gii-1.1.13/ModelCode.php -- I think this is a file that should be included in .gitignore.... not sure though
protected/models/User.php -- File generated by Gii. Goto this url 'http://localhost/Yii-Tutorial/index.php?r=gii/model' to generate this. The password is 'password', fill in 'user' for Table name, click preview, then generate.
protected/test/unit/user_model.php -- Added tests to ensure the model checks for password matching. Also added tests to ensure clear text passwords are not stored in the database, and removed from memory after they are saved
protected/test/unit/user_model.php -- Added tests to ensure the hashed password matches the original password when compared
protected/test/unit/user_model.php -- Refactored and corrected errors in the test.

protected/migrations/m130129_000236_increase_user_password_length.php -- Increased the password size to 60. All password hashes are 60 characters
protected/models/User.php -- Added code to verify the password was 60 characters long. This should probably be removed as it may cause problems in the views
												  -- Also added code to turn the password into a hash and a function to compare a password against the hash
protected/extensions/Bcrypt.php -- Code to turn a password into a hash. I found this online and copied it without modification
protected/config/main.php -- Added a line that will search the extension directory for helper classes, this allows us to use the bcrypt class
protected/redo_migrations.sh -- Script file to automate redoing migrations for all databases
