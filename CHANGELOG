protected/runtime/gii-1.1.13/ModelCode.php -- I think this is a file that should be included in .gitignore.... not sure though
protected/models/User.php -- File generated by Gii. Goto this url 'http://localhost/Yii-Tutorial/index.php?r=gii/model' to generate this. The password is 'password', fill in 'user' for Table name, click preview, then generate.
protected/test/unit/user_model.php -- Added tests to ensure the model checks for password matching. Also added tests to ensure clear text passwords are not stored in the database, and removed from memory after they are saved
